Design-Automation
=================

A collection of design focused automation apps/scripts. **Please be warned** I am a hack, so if it is broken I am sorry I usually try and be thoughtful with my code but sometimes it just is made to work for me.

## Apps

* Just add "-[DPI size]" after your asset in generation and then drag all the final assets to this app and it will sort them to folders and delete the extra extention.
* Exporting the **Artboards** from a selected Sketch File in the finder.
* Exporting the **Pages** from a selected Sketch File in the finder.
* Exporting the **Slices** from a selected Sketch File in the finder.
