Design-Automation
=================

A collection of design focused automation apps/scripts. **Please be warned** I am a hack, so if it is broken I am sorry I usually try and be thoughtful with my code but sometimes it just is made to work for me.

## Apps

- **android-sort-DPI.app** All the design apps will generate/export assets for you but wont put the various DPI (Android) sizes into their folder convention. So this is how I handle that.
  * Just add "-[DPI size]" after your asset in generation and then drag all the final assets to this app and it will sort them to folders and delete the extra extention.
- **download-install_sketchtool.app/.scpt** Sketchtool is rad, but when it came out it was hard to find on their site and there wasn't any documentation on where or how to install it. This script trys to take care of that.
- **sketch-export-artboard.app/.scpt** This script using "Sketchtool" will export all the artboards in a sketch document that it is given
- **sketch-export-page.app/.scpt** This script using "Sketchtool" will export all the pages in a sketch document that it is given
