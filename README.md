Design-Automation
=================

A collection of design focused automation apps/scripts. **Please be warned** I am a hack, so if it is broken I am sorry I usually try and be thoughtful with my code but sometimes it just is made to work for me.

### Exporting Sketch Workflows (require [Sketchtool](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/tool/))
* Exporting the **Artboards** from a selected Sketch File in the finder.
* Exporting the **Pages** from a selected Sketch File in the finder.
* Exporting the **Slices** from a selected Sketch File in the finder.
* Also included a **Alfred Script** that uses these with the "File Selection" Option
Can use Applescripts or install the Workflows and use them directly from the finder!!!!!

## Other Workflows
* Android file sorting â€” Just add "-[DPI size]" after your asset in generation and then drag all the final assets to this app and it will sort them to folders and delete the extra extention.

## Sketch Plugins
* Various ones that will update from time to time.

*Note: src is the playground for all of these little tools so be careful*
